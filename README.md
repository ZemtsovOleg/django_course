# Django Course Projects

Welcome to the "Django Course Projects" repository! Here, I showcase my solutions to coding problems and exercises from a Django web framework course. Each subfolder represents a separate project, covering various aspects of Django development.

## Projects

The repository comprises the following projects:

my_page: The simplest project focusing on foundational concepts.
user_project: A comprehensive project covering user registration, password reset via email, and more.
authentication: A small project testing a basic registration mechanism.
form_project: An exploration of working with forms in Django.
movie_proj: A project dedicated to utilizing Django ORM for managing movie data.
