# Django Course Projects

Welcome to the "Django Course Projects" repository! Here, I showcase my solutions to coding problems and exercises from a Django web framework course. Each subfolder represents a separate project, covering various aspects of Django development.

## Projects

The repository comprises the following projects:  
__my_page:__ The simplest project focusing on foundational concepts.  
__user_project:__ A comprehensive project covering user registration, password reset via email, and more.  
__authentication:__ A small project testing a basic registration mechanism.  
__form_project:__ An exploration of working with forms in Django.  
__movie_proj:__ A project dedicated to utilizing Django ORM for managing movie data.
