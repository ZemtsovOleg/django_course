''' In your Django apps, use settings by importing the object django.conf.settings

Also note that your code should not import from either global_settings or your own settings file. django.conf.settings abstracts the concepts of default settings and site-specific settings; it presents a single interface. It also decouples the code that uses settings from the location of your settings.

Because a settings file contains sensitive information, such as the database password, you should make every attempt to limit access to it. For example, change its file permissions so that only you and your web serverâ€™s user can read it. This is especially important in a shared-hosting environment. '''
